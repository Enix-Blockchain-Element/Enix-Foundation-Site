// WHAT IS ENIX BLOCKCHAIN
// Enix Chain is ACTIVE, now its time to spread it.
Opening your systems up to run ENIX Blockchain means you become part of what we believe could be the future of decentralising AI technologies. Outsourcing & sharding executable AI files across a network of servers in such a fashion is taking global computing literally. Maintaining a core control element where the main action happens but pushing data storage and essential processing out into the wild and rewarding the people responsible. 

// Using the ENIX network, to run your systems, frees your core servers to do what they do best while providing huge scope for additional computing power through the application of the nodes and shared compute. Databases shared across multiple servers linked through the commonality of immutable blockchain and easily navigated route-maps providing access to always-on AI derived data, giving and taking from an ever expanding stream
